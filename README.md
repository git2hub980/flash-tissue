# Flash-Tissue Oxygen & Pneumonia Risk Demo

**Hackathon Project | Browser-based Demo | No Download Required**

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **Flash-Tissue finger test** to estimate blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and compute a simple **risk score** based on symptoms.  
It also includes a **simulated chest X-ray upload** feature for demo purposes.

> ⚠ This is a hackathon demo. **Not a medical device**.

## Features

1. **Flash-Tissue Finger Test**  
   - Uses your device camera and flash to estimate SpO₂.  
   - Provides a basic risk assessment: Mild, Moderate, High.

2. **Symptoms-based Risk Score**  
   - Users can select fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  
   - Combines with SpO₂ to calculate overall risk.

3. **X-ray Upload (Simulated)**  
   - Upload a chest X-ray image.  
   - Returns a **simulated prediction** (Normal / Pneumonia) with confidence.
